    "Your assignment for today is to create a parking garage class to get more familiar with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). This project would usually be a pair programming project. However, for the size our class we will have groups of 3. This means, that one person(The driver) will code the project while the other people(The navigators)will brainstorm and guide to a working solution.\n",
    "Each of you should share/switch these roles every 30mins-1hr -- Or you may elect to switch \"drivers\" after creating specific methods of the class.\n",
